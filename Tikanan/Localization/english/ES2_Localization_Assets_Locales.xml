  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionMajorMDescription">Diablo the Dread-lord is as mysterious as he is violent. Leading the largest fleet in the galaxy from an unknown location, his army ravages what remains of the native civilisations for resources. 

His fear inducing ferocity has led to his supporters viewing him as a living God. Diablo's motives are purely selfish: he is longing for complete control and dominion over the last galaxy.</LocalizationPair>             <!--Faction Description-->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsMajorM">A common enemy indicates a common bond. We Aurigans appreciate this.</LocalizationPair>     <!-- Presumably not needed until custom AI is made-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeMajorM">The Aurigans have needs that must be met, and we feel that you can help us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeMajorM">We remember much, we Aurigans, and we will remember your open hostility to our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeMajorM">You have no cause and no right to take your war to innocent victims!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassMajorM">We seldom welcome strangers. You are not an exception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingMajorM">We too see the need to travel and explore. But we don't want you doing it in our territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationMajorM">We have a long history of fighting for our territory, and against foes more worthy than you. Remove your colony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionMajorM">Do you really believe that space is a free-for-all? Perhaps we will colonize your territory next.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemMajorM">Boundaries in space are less clear than they were on Auriga. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryMajorM">When friends visit, they usually leave their weapons at home. Why are yours in our space?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeMajorM">We strive to be beacons of virtue, yet you treat us like slaves. You disgust me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistMajorM">Desperate times require extreme actions; I had no choice but to do what is best for the Aurigans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceMajorM">We appear to not be enemies. Perhaps the time will come when we can be friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverMajorM">You are like mercenaries of the clansmen, who pretend to trade while sharpening their swords.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionMajorM">Many times in our past we have been trapped, cut off, enclosed. Know that it usually goes badly for those who try it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandMajorM">Your greed is unpleasant, and coming from one we viewed as a friend it is contemptuous. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedMajorM">I will be honest: Aurigans are uneasy exposing ourselves, even to those we trust. We appreciate your willingness to take the same risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedMajorM">As First of the Bloodline, I accept your tithe. All Aurigans thank you for your donation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionMajorM">We can no longer accept your drive to control and conquer. Though they call us MajorM, we do not run and hide from battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionMajorM">My kin are uneasy with your actions and distrust your motives. Our borders are closed, and our hearts cold.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedMajorM">You relent in your desires to take the lives of my people. As First of the Bloodline, I may begin to trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedMajorM">I do not mean to be cruel or arbitrary. I simply do what I must for the Aurigans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractMajorM">We struck a bargain that benefits everyone. There's nothing wrong with that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsMajorM">MajorM seldom forget enemies. But we prefer to see them become friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledMajorM">Our tradition of protecting our borders is historic. Thank you for respecting Aurigan territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsMajorM">At least you show the honesty of direct attack, rather than pretending your ships were just passing through. Commendable, for vermin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedMajorM">Apparently you do not take a firm warning from the Aurigans seriously. You insult me and my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightMajorM">I do not care if it is ignorance or aggressiveness. You have decided to ring the bells of war, and the Aurigans do not fear that sound.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingMajorM">Theft of our systems, disrespect of our borders. Your list of provocations grows long, and the famous Vaulter temper grows short.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationMajorM">You treat our territory as if it was your playground. The colony you established is not welcome, and if we come it will not be to play.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersMajorM">Vaulter territory is closed to you. The kin are content to keep you out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersMajorM">Your constant trespassing reminds us of the incursions of Necrophage scouts. We preferred to slaughter Necrophage scouts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsMajorM">You will see the Aurigans are an adaptable people. We do not fear cold war or the heat of battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonMajorM">Take your Dust and trinkets elsewhere. We would not be bribed by the Clans, and we won't be bribed by you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedMajorM">This is the behavior we expect from Necrophage insects. Like insects, you will be exterminated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementMajorM">The Aurigans seek many things. Knowledge is precious, and a pooling of our scientific wisdom would benefit all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorM">We could better secure our future if we could better secure our revenue. We wonder if a commercial agreement would aid both my kin and your people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorM">It is time to harvest the true value of peaceful relations--trade! MajorM are known to be shrewd, but honest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementMajorM">I speak not only for myself, but for my kin. All Aurigans are content that our peaceful relations have endured when so much else seems ephemeral.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementMajorM">It is good to see the kin thrive; our trade agreement has done much good for the MajorM.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandOrTrespassedMajorM">I would like an explanation for your actions. Is our Peace no longer useful to you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementMajorM">There is little the Aurigans value more than science, and our agreement has helped us improve our research. Let us hope this cooperation continues.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandMajorM">Would it not be more polite and less abrasive to ask, rather than demand? We do not--or did not--view you as an enemy of the MajorM.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyMajorM">We note your friendly ships in our space. We Aurigans trust that they plan to remain friendly, and our relationship cordial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceMajorM">We do not wish to appear demanding. But as First of the Bloodline I have the task to maintain the sovereignty of my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorM">Why are your fleets in our territory? It is like waking up and finding Necrophages have invited themselves to breakfast.  You are not ready for a lasting peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumMajorM">Perhaps I was not clear. The Aurigans do not want your fleets in our territory. We insist that you remove them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureMajorM">You were happy to make a demand on my people, yet you feel no need to thank or compensate us. Perhaps you should consider that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorM">Aurigans tire of waking up and seeing your fleets at our door. You have decided to end this peace; we will move to a status of cold war if practical.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassMajorM">I thank you for removing your fleets from Vaulter territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureMajorM">You refuse point blank to make a gesture of thanks or reconciliation? We are no longer interested in agreements and discussions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureMajorM">I speak for all my kin; we are somewhat reassured by your gesture. Remember that diplomacy is a delicate art, and your hands appear clumsy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpMajorM">The kin are under pressure; powers of the galaxy that we are ill-prepared to repulse are arrayed against us. What would you say if the Aurigans were to extend a hand?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorM">I see alliances forming that risk doing great damage to my kin. The Aurigan Federacy is beginning to consider alliances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpMajorM">While we share peaceful relations, others are more willing to do harm to my kin. I wonder if you would consider joining with us. That galaxy is large enough that we can share!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorM">As great alliances form, the Aurigan Federacy feels isolated. Frankly, I am considering proposing an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyMajorM">We are like doctors, fighting a common plague. My kin begin to wonder if a formal alliance would serve both our interests better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsMajorM">We have been at peace, you and I, as have our people. My kin are content with this, and voices have begun to whisper thoughts of an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryMajorM">The shape of power in the galaxy becomes clear. You and I lead our peoples down the same path to success. As allies, this success might become even more secure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpMajorM">By tradition and by contract, the Aurigans request your aid in our current conflict!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyMajorM">I am sometimes chastized for treating my people too much like family. But such is my weakness, and as an ally, you too are family. And family comes first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftMajorM">I give you this in thanks for our continued good fortune in this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftMajorM">Please accept this heartfelt expression of the Aurigans appreciation for our ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedMajorM">When friends begin to make demands without a gesture of appreciation, it means the friendship is over. The Aurigans regret what we must do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandMajorM">I would have thought that the status of "ally" made demands unnecessary. That is how Aurigans treat our friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftMajorM">We have seen alliances threatened before, but usually from without. Had you not made this gift, ours would have been threatened from within.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftMajorM">I feel that our alliance holds little value for you; a true friends and ally would understand the difference between "gift" and "pittance."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedMajorM">Ages of seeking and suffereing have made the MajorM strong and adaptable. We may perhaps adapt to this alliance in its current form, in spite of your past actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateMajorM">I speak for my kin when I say better late than never. Would that your aid might have come sooner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedMajorM">I do not beg. But I do remind you of our alliance and of your promises. You have spurned my kin in our time of need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftMajorM">You may call it a pleasant name like "conversion", but the Aurigan Federacy cannot tolerate the theft of a system from a so-called ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleMajorM">Is it that you lack the courage to wage war, but hide behind propaganda and marketing campaigns? Your continued occupation of Aurigan systems leaves us no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianMajorM">We see this as a gift, as if a member of your kin has joined ours. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemMajorM">We understand the virtues of this unusual presence. Vaulter society hopes to benefit from it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarMajorM">Your suicidal tendencies are noted. Once we are finished over here, the Aurigan Federacy will be more than happy to bring you down.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandMajorM">This declaration is not out of anger or spite. The Aurigans are throttled in our current situation, and see no choice but to fight our way out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarMajorM">Your war serves our purpose. My kin see this as an advantageous moment to strike out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarMajorM">Our populations starve, and you prefer to worsen the situation. Why do you attempt mass murder of my kin?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarMajorM">You butcher civilians like the honorless Necrophage. We destroyed them, and if we must, we will destroy you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarMajorM">What monster have you conjured among my people? It will not change the course of the war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarMajorM">I see you are without soul or morals. Apparently butchery is your favorite pastime, and the blood of innocents your favorite drink.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceMajorM">This strange phenomenon you have placed on our system is greatly appreciated, if not entirely understood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceMajorM">I do not see why you seek to cripple my kin while our empires are at peace. What is the meaning of this sorcery?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumMajorM">I see you are proud of your power and glory, but the Aurigans would prefer to rule themselves. Do not take over our systems--by any means.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumMajorM">At this, the Aurigans draw a line in the snow. You have stolen another system, and we do not believe you have any interest in peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumMajorM">The Aurigans are glad you stopped trying to separate them from their kin by converting other systems. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleMajorM">I did not expect this sort of action from you. The Aurigan Federacy appreciates your gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleMajorM">Perhaps you placed this singularity to ensure that this cold war heats up? If you continue, you will learn that as a people we are unafraid of battle.</LocalizationPair>
  
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemMajorM">Don't blockade</LocalizationPair> <!--Answer to a blockade of a system-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetMajorM">Don't boom boom</LocalizationPair> <!-- Answer to destroying a planet under faction influence-->
  
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonMajorM">I won</LocalizationPair>   <!-- Your outpost turned first in a system-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostMajorM">I lost</LocalizationPair>  <!-- enemy outpost turned first in a system-->
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedMajorM">I do not make demands idly. You chose to ignore it, and the Aurigans see this as an act of disrespect.</LocalizationPair> <!-- Presumably not needed until custom AI is made-->
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsMajorM">I have no desire to go to war at this point; please simply keep your ships out of Vaulter territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksMajorM">My kin have suffered long and struggled to survive. The war goes badly for us, and we hope you are not a maniac bent on genocide.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredMajorM">My kin face some concerns that we would rather keep to ourselves. Our borders are closed to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarMajorM">Vaulter ships and fleets occasionally need live practice, and your continual provocation has given us an excellent excuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarMajorM">My kin are being throttled by frontiers and starlanes; we must expand if we are to survive.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetMajorM">The insanity of this weapon proves the instability of your mind. The Aurigans will see you punished for this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetMajorM">Why do you gain such pleasure from the mindless slaughter of my people? Do you find such joy in genocide? No sentient could act this way!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetMajorM">You view my kin as targets for your weapons of butchery? If other empires do not destroy you, the gods certainly will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsMajorM">I thought that the Aurigans would be safe once we accepted your ridiculous demand. But it seems your mind is not stable enough to comprehend this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleMajorM">It is not that my kin abhor peace, but you use it like a weapon of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidMajorM">I expected  fleets of ships, not an offer of peace. I will not hide the Aurigans' feeling of releif.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryMajorM">Forcing a peace is like choking someone with dessert. It is not a friendly act, and we still do not trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureMajorM">Your protestations of peaceful appear -- surprisingly -- to be supported by your actions. Vaulter systems are content to see this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceMajorM">You are skilled at forcing peace, but incapable of understanding it. I and my kin do not understand or trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithMajorM">I see your show of good intent. But a more concrete example of your good will would go far to reassuring the Aurigans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedMajorM">You are able to both think and listen. In this galaxy that is unusual, and the Aurigans appreciate your efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedMajorM">I have not seen an interest in your part in our well-being. With no show of good faith, I will counsel the Aurigans to treat you with distrust.</LocalizationPair>
  
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionMajorM">Your attempts to suffocate us with peace has only resulted in making the Aurigans angrer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedMajorM">Save your words. Save your breath. We will no longer speak with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationInvadedInCWMajorM">You have your fury, and the MajorM have ours. Time will tell which burns the hotter.</LocalizationPair>
  
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedColdWarMajorM">Your action is unacceptable, even in cold war. You stole a system, and I shall have it back.</LocalizationPair> <!-- Converted system during cold war-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedPeaceMajorM">Your clever propaganda and conversion of systems do not fool us. You have comitted an act of war against the MajorM, and we will respond in kind.</LocalizationPair> <!-- Converted system during peace-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedAllianceMajorM">You spit upon the letter and the spirit of this alliance. The MajorM will not be spit upon.</LocalizationPair> <!-- Converted system during alliance-->
  
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedMajorMWinning">MajorM are content to win without destroying. We are prepared to offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedMajorMWinning">I find your offer interesting; much can be done in peace that cannot be done in war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedMajorMLosing">I see that the gods do not favor the Aurigans this time. I ask for a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedMajorMLosing">Only the gods really know how this may have ended, but we are content to accept your offer of a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedMajorM">My kin are unhappy with your provocations. Peace does not honestly describe our current relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedMajorM">Your insistance at increased tensions between us may come back to haunt you. The Aurigans do not always seek war, but we never fear it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedMajorM">Your obvious contempt for me and my people is intolerable. Our alliance is nullified, and the MajorM prepare for the worst.</LocalizationPair>                    <!-- Going from Alliance to ColdWar, from-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedMajorM">I am stunned that you so violently withdraw from an alliance to agitate for war. Aurigans have long memories, and this will not be forgotten.</LocalizationPair>  <!-- Going from Alliance to ColdWar, to-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedMajorM">Even among MajorM bad blood occurs. We had hoped the truce would last, but you do not permit that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedMajorM">Was this truce your flimsy excuse to re-arm and attack my kin? You will regret the day you chose this deception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedMajorM">I am not a violent person, but in this case I am forced to do what is best for my kin: war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorM">As First of the Bloodline I both acknowledge and accept this declaration. You will have a belly full of war before this is over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedMajorM">The Aurigans tire of your actions and words. The only way to force you to listen, is to use force.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedMajorM">MajorM have had many enemies before you, and will doubtless have many more after you are gone. It is war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedMajorM">Life is full of unfortunate necessities. I do not take war or the lives of my kin lightly. But our alliance must be broken, and the dogs of war unchained.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedMajorM">It is difficult for me to see this as anything other than the utmost treachery. Your lack of morals gives the advantage, and the ships of the Aurigan Federacy will do the rest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedMajorM">So a truce was not to your liking. Not enough Aurigan blood spilled? Not enough innocents murdered? Regardless, we are the MajorM. We do not tremble before you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedMajorM">I do not believe that cold war benefits either of our people. I offer the branch of peace, and the hopes of better relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorM">I will not be the one to refuse this offer. May the Aurigans and your peoples prosper from more peaceful relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedMajorM">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationReceiverRefusedMajorM">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedMajorM">The Aurigans have had enough of provocations and pointless skirmishes. Let us end this, and form an alliance to face the dangers of the galaxy together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorM">I did not expect this! I believe that my kin will accept, and I will not stand in their way. Let us see what this brings us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedMajorM">The Aurigan Federacy, quite frankly, does not trust you. We are not prepared to be allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedMajorM">It seems to be a logical step. We can gain more and achieve more in an alliance, shoulder to shoulder.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedMajorM">The Aurigans have learned to trust you. Our peace was fruitful, and we hope the alliance will be doubly so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedMajorM">We are not ready for this; not yet. I am oathbound to guard the interests of my people, and this alliance would not serve them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedMajorM">As First of the Bloodline and leader of the great Aurigan people, I offer you this proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedMajorM">It is not as welcome summer on Auriga, but it is certainly agreeable. I accept your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedMajorM">I do not feel that this proposal does sufficient honor to my kin. I cannot accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredMajorM">I do not have time to speak, and my kin are not concerned with your queries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedMajorM">I will do, and have always done, what is necessary for my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedMajorM">So this is what you desire? I have learned much today.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedMajorM">The Aurigan Federacy salutes those who share our ideals of knowledge and independence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedMajorM">I am generally suspicious of diplomatic compliments, but your words are greatly appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedMajorM">My kin and I find you faithless and repulsive; you are like Necrophages, but with fancier guns.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedMajorM">If I was as thin-skinned and insecure as you are, this might bother me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedMajorM">Do not take this as an insult, but as a simple expression of our needs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedMajorM">I do not know if I will comply. But the Aurigans will not forget how you treated us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedMajorM">I do not care if you think that the Aurigans have not been provoked. I feel that we have, so now it is war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedMajorM">Let me clarify the position of the MajorM: if you demand this, you better be willing to die for it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedMajorM">Trade is not the lifeblood of my kin. But we are not so foolish as to let opportunities slip by!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedMajorM">The Aurigans are content to deal with you; may we all grow greater in knowledge and in wealth!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedMajorM">This things you wish to trade are not the things my kin value. You are like the least useful of the Roving Clans, but with faster mounts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreemenSenderProposedMajorM">Our scientific prowess and our seekers of knowledge are widely envied. Would you like to share in our discoveries?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedMajorM">Knowledge is a thing of great value to me and my kin; we are content to accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedMajorM">You would suck our brains dry and in return give us little of value, I think. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedMajorMPrepareWar">The Aurigans have faced greater threats and greater foes than you. We await battle eagerly, sure of our fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedMajorM">You vacillate like the wind. If you are really sure you want war, the Aurigans are really sure we will win it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedMajorM">The galaxy is full of wonders, but also of traitors. If you wish to close your borders, we are glad to keep you out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedMajorM">I am hesitant to give those who are not Aurigans the run of our territory. But risk is sometimes necessary, and we trust that the rewards will be good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedMajorM">My kin and I are not feeling trustful or friendly at the moment. We do not seek to have the fleets of other peoples sniffing around our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedMajorM">The Aurigans have gotten little but grief for our openness. Our borders and our hearts are now closed to foreigners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedMajorM">I am prepared--cautiously--to open our borders to other empires. Can you be trusted with this honor?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredMajorM">My counsel is my own. The First of the Bloodline will not speak with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedMajorM">MajorM are also not a gregarious people. But we are content to meet you at last, and hope that our relations enrich us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedMajorM">I am First of the Bloodline, leader of the people from Auriga known as the MajorM. May the Great Orrery tick on in our favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedMajorM">The Aurigans are questers and seekers of knowledge; we would be content to exchange astronomical data.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedMajorM">The more we seek together, the more we will learn. My kin are content to share our vision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedMajorM">We do not understand why you suddenly reduce our ability to gather information. That is important to the MajorM.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedMajorM">If you prefer to have less wealth and power, it does not concern me or my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedMajorM">Our science is the envy of many, and you no longer desire this agreement? I find you both surprising and confused.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorM">Together we can see more and know more. The Aurigans do not find a drawback in any of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorM">The information you bring is greatly outweighed by the information you absort. This agreement is not in the interest of the MajorM.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedMajorM">To map the galaxy and track the stars: it seems unthinkable. Together, however, we will do it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedMajorM">For many ages we have studied the history and science of the galaxy. Our combined knowledge would be an even greater boon to understanding these things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedMajorM">A truce suits us; we are content to watch and wait.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedMajorM">I do not exult in destruction. What do you say to a truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedMajorM">I would do a disservice to my kin to accept a truce as flimsy as this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedMajorM">We have traveled and learned much of the stars, but we prefer to keep these secrets to ourselves. We are not interested in your maps.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedMajorM">What we can see is for Aurigan eyes only. We are not interested in you seeing what we see.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementSenderSignedMajorM">The kin are happy to keep our science to ourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementSenderSignedMajorM">We have been trading for centuries, and can do quite well on our own.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedMajorM">Peace is something that is earned and deserved, not declared and imposed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationSenderSignedMajorM">This action may seem strange. To the kin, it seems necessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualFleetRemovalDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you remove your fleets that trespass in our territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualColonizationConcurrenceDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you remove colonies that border our territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualFleetDefenseDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you stop attacking our fleets and systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualPacificConversionDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you cease this "peaceful" theft of our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualLeechingDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you stop drawing the life from people in our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualTimeBubblesDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you remove your time manipulations from our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualRootingDialogueMajorM">The MajorM insist that you remove your vines from our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSenderSignedMajorM">The needs of my kin mean that I must impose this policy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationReceiverSignedMajorM">None of us like being told what to do. Next time ask, don't impose!</LocalizationPair>
